## Global Variables

- `maxClosingMovingAverages`: Maximum number of MAs for closing trades.
- `slopeRange`: Slope range for ignoring trade signals.

## Expert Initialization Function

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called when the Expert Advisor is being removed from the chart or during the platform shutdown. Any cleanup code can be added here.

## Expert Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is called on every tick of the chart. This is where the main logic of the Expert Advisor is implemented.

- If the conditions are met, a market order is executed based on the MA crossover strategy using the `OpenTrade()` function.
- The function also checks if all conditions are met for closing a trade using the `CanCloseTrade()` function.
- If the conditions are met, the trade is closed using the `CloseTrade()` function.

## Custom Functions for Moving Average Calculations

- `CalculateSlope(double[] values)`: This function calculates the slope of a series of values.

## Custom Functions for ADX Indicator Calculations

## Product Description

The Dream Catcher Expert Advisor, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team, is a powerful tool that utilizes a Moving Average crossover strategy to execute market orders. With customizable parameters such as the maximum number of MAs for opening and closing trades, slope range for ignoring trade signals, and an optional ADX filter, traders have the flexibility to adapt the Expert Advisor to their preferred trading style.

The Expert Advisor's main logic is implemented in the `OnTick()` function, which continuously checks for trade entry and exit conditions. When all conditions are met for opening a trade, the Expert Advisor executes a market order based on the MA crossover strategy. Similarly, when all conditions are met for closing a trade, the Expert Advisor closes the trade.

Traders can further customize the Expert Advisor by adjusting the parameters such as the maximum number of MAs, slope range, and enabling or disabling the ADX filter. These features allow traders to fine-tune the Expert Advisor's performance based on their own trading preferences and strategies.
